# Computer Science Jargon
A list of jargon in my field (computer science/cyber security) and what people actually mean.

Pull requests are appreciated.  There is a lot of ground to cover.  Try to keep it related to programming, computer science, cyber security, and not related to things like running a startup, or other boring things.

**grok**: to look at something and understand it.
> I wasn't able to grok his code, it was too confusing
